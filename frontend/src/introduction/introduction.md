This is a collection of mostly print advertisements for the
Welte-Mignon reproducing piano, encoded in TEI. The project
was created as part of an PhD project
"Interpretationsnetzwerke" at the University TÃ¼bingen which
considers piano rolls as objects of a digital edition. It
can be accessed [here](https://measuring-early-records.org).

## Choice of Material
The present collection includes advertisements, which:

- appear in print publications between 1905 and 1930
- advertise the Welte-Mignon reproducing piano
- are published by either the company M. Welte & Sons itself
  or one of the licensee companies.
