This is a collection of mostly print advertisements for the
Welte-Mignon reproducing piano, encoded in TEI. The project
was created as part of an PhD project
"Interpretationsnetzwerke" at the University TÃ¼bingen which
considers piano rolls as objects of a digital edition. It
can be accessed [here](https://measuring-early-records.org).
