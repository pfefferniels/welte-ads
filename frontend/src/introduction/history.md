In 1923, William C. Heaton, president of the
[Auto Pneumatic Action Co.](/companies/auto.pneumatic.action), 
announced a nation-wide advertising plan starting from March of the 
same year,[^1] not only to increase the sales of Welte-Mignon equipped
pianos, but also to "acquaint the general public with exactly what 
the reproducing piano is and how it differs from the regular foot-pumped
player piano".[^2] The "Frank Seaman Inc." was chosen as a advertising agency.
