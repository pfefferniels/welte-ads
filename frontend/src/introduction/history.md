## History
In 1923, William C. Heaton, president of the
[Auto Pneumatic Action Co.](/companies/auto.pneumatic.action), 
announced a nation-wide advertising campaign starting from March of the 
same year,[^1] not only to increase the sales of Welte-Mignon equipped
pianos, but also to "acquaint the general public with exactly what 
the reproducing piano is and how it differs from the regular foot-pumped
player piano".[^2] The "Frank Seaman Inc." was chosen as a advertising agency.
These ads were published in color in a set of magazines known as
"The Quality Group".[^4]

1927 The "Auto-Pneumatic Action Company" tries to advertise reproducing pianos
for popular music.[^6]

Again in December 1927, William Heaton announced plans to "more aggresively
than ever" promote the reproducing mechanism in 1928.[^3]


## Decline of Reproducing Piano Industry
In 1930 William C. Heaton becomes general director of the
Kolo Products Company.[^5]
