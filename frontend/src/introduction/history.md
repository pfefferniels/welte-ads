## Ad Series

### "When Phantom Finger's Play" (1923/24)
In 1923, William C. Heaton, president of the
[Auto Pneumatic Action Co.](/companies/auto.pneumatic.action), 
announced a nation-wide advertising campaign starting from March of the 
same year,[^1] not only to increase the sales of Welte-Mignon equipped
pianos, but also to "acquaint the general public with exactly what 
the reproducing piano is and how it differs from the regular foot-pumped
player piano".[^2] The "Frank Seaman Inc." was chosen as a advertising agency.
These ads were published in color in a different magazines: in the *Saturday 
Evening Post*, the "Quality Group"[^4] of magazines as well as *House and Garden*
and *Vogue*.[^12] The company proudly announces –

> "Never before have reproducing
> pianos been advertised in so impressive a manner. Never before has the public
> been told as clearly what a reproducing piano is and what it does." 

– and directed towards sellers:

> "This attention-compelling advertising will help you sell your Welte-Mignon
> equipped Reproducing Piano.[^13]

The textes were written by Harriette Segall and Barbara Peverly.[^14] The
Frank Seaman Inc. displayed two of the paintings of De Feo (Welanetz Co.)
for the Welte Mignon in an Exhibition of the *Art Director's Club*.[^11]
Considerable efforts have been made to emphasize the artistic
quality of the Welte Mignon reproduction piano.

### "That's Why I Bought It" (1927)
In 1927, another series of color ads was announced
in *The Music Trades*:[^9]

> "One of the most convincing series of color
> advertisements ever devised in behalf of reproducing
> pianos will present the 1927 story of the
> Welte-Mignon (Licensee) to the buying public of
> America. Those who have seen advance proofs of
> these advertisements have pronounced them a 
> deperature in piano advertising history. The colors
> are exquisitely blended and woven into patterns."

This series has appeared in "House and Garden",
"Vanity Fair",  "House Beautiful" and "Vogue".
Other than announced it did not appear in "Country Life".[^10]

#### Examples
- ["It brings the world's greatest pianist into my home"](/ad029)
- ["The realism of its playing is almost beyond belief"](/ad030)

1927 The *Auto-Pneumatic Action Company* tries to advertise reproducing pianos
for popular music.[^6]

### 1928 - Last Advertising Series
When in the end of 1927 the *Welte Mignon Corporation* was subject
of "receivership in equity" proceedings, William Heaton issued 
a statement to clarify, that there were no associations whatsoever 
between the *Welte Mignon Corporation* and the *Auto Pneumatic 
Action Company*, whose president he was. In the same statement, 
he announced plans to "more aggresively than ever" promote the
reproducing mechanism in 1928.[^3]

### Decline of Reproducing Piano Industry
Since February 1929 the *Welte Mignon Corporation* was managed
by an equity receiver.
Also the Auto Pneumatic Action Company seems to fade away.

In May 1928, William C. Heaton became "general wholesale Sales
Manager of the piano division" of the Welte Mignon Corporation.
In 1929 he changed to the Zenith Radio Corporation,
just a year later he becomes general director of the
Kolo Products Company.[^5] Also Paul Brown Klugh, former director
of the Autopiano Co., went to the radio bussiness.[^8]
Albert Whitham, superintendent of the factory of the
Welte Mignon Corporation, changed to the Austin Organ Company.[^7]

      ad (The Quality Group, ad in *The Printer's Ink*, June 30, 1927,
      without page [p. 88]). It is worth nothing that also The Aeolian
      Company praised its *Duo-Art Reproducing Piano* in the same
      journals with a remarkable, four pages spanning advert.
